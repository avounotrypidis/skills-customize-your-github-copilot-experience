# 📘 Assignment: Statistics with Python

## 🎯 Objective

Master data analysis and statistical calculations using pandas and numpy. You'll learn to load datasets, compute descriptive statistics, analyze distributions, and visualize insights to understand real-world data patterns and relationships.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Load and Explore Data with Pandas

#### Description
Load a CSV dataset using pandas and perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and content of your data.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Load a CSV file using pandas.read_csv()
- Display basic information about the dataset (shape, column names, data types)
- Show summary statistics (mean, median, std deviation, min, max) using describe()
- Identify and handle missing values (count and display)
- Display the first and last rows of the dataset


### 🛠️ Compute Descriptive Statistics

#### Description
Calculate various statistical measures on your dataset to summarize key characteristics of the data.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Calculate mean, median, and mode for numerical columns
- Compute standard deviation and variance
- Find quartiles and interquartile range (IQR)
- Identify outliers using statistical methods
- Generate correlation matrix for numerical features


### 🛠️ Data Manipulation and Aggregation

#### Description
Transform and aggregate your data to extract meaningful insights and answer specific questions about the dataset.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Filter data based on specific conditions
- Create new calculated columns
- Group data by categories and compute aggregate statistics
- Sort data by one or more columns
- Create a summary report with key statistics by group


### 🛠️ Visualize Statistical Distributions

#### Description
Create visualizations to represent statistical distributions and relationships in your data.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create histograms to show distribution of numerical variables
- Generate box plots to visualize quartiles and outliers
- Create scatter plots to explore relationships between variables
- Use appropriate labels, titles, and legends
- Save visualizations as image files
